## Contributing 

This project is using `golem`, a principled framework for building Shiny apps. Read more about `golem` [here](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/index.html). The rtask blog posts and getting started articles are particularly helpful. In brief, `golem` treats a shiny app as an R package. Each component of the app should be built as a module (instantiated with `golem::add_module()`. Each module should represent a single chunk of the app, for example, a panel for selecting data, or a plot of a dataset. Add packages as you would with a typical R package: `usethis::use_package(<package>)` to add the package to DESCRIPTION file, and then explicitly referencing the package when using functions (eg. `purrr::pluck()`). Run the script in `dev/run_dev.R` to run the app locally. 

Please PR in digestible chunks - 1 or 2 modules per PR, maximum. Please PR against the `develop` branch.
